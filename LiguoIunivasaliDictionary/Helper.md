# About this language

- ## Syntax & Constituents

  Basic syntatic structure: `VSO`, which is `V<S|O>`. Clauses are inserted before verb phrase or noun phrase, which is `[Clause]VP` or `[Clause]NP`. 
  > Note: **[**, **]**, **<**, **>** and **|** can be treated as preposition. They are actually unique constituent markers in _Ligouni_.
